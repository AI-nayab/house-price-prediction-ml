 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using the California Housing dataset.

A Linear Regression model was built to understand how different features like income, house age, population, and location affect house prices.

This project demonstrates the complete Machine Learning workflow.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To develop a model that can predict house prices based on given input features.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is the California Housing dataset from Scikit-learn.

It includes:

- Median Income
- House Age
- Average Rooms
- Population
- Latitude & Longitude

Target Variable:
**Median House Value**

---

## ⚙️ Model Used
Linear Regression

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated using:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

### Results:

MAE  : 0.53  
RMSE : 0.73  
R² Score : 0.60  

---

## 📉 Visualization
A scatter plot was created to compare actual vs predicted house prices.
